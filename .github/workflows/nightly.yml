# This pipeline runs nightly. It updates the recipe to build the latest commit
# from "main" in the TileDB-SOMA repo, and force pushes to the branch
# "nightly-build", which triggers the feedstock builds on Azure. It also sets
# `upload_on_branch` in `conda-forge.yml` to "nightly-build" and rerenders, so the
# binaries are uploaded to anaconda.org
