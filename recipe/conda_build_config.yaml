# conda-forge has migrated to newer versions of fmt and spdlog. We need fmt 9 to
# install into our existing TileDB Cloud conda environments, so we build a
# special variant of fmt 9 and spdlog 1.11. And because this can no longer solve
# with conda-forge depedencies, we install the "for-cloud" tiledb binary from
# tiledb/label/for-cloud

# Because of the awkwardness required for the cloud variant above
# (fmt9+spdlog1.11), we also have to manually pin fmt/spdlog for the osx-*
# builds
