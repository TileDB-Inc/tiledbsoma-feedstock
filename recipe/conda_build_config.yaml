# What follows is the "non-default stuff" block.
# conda-forge has migrated to fmt 10 and spdlog 1.12. We need fmt 9 to install
# into our existing TileDB Cloud conda environments, so we build a special
# variant of fmt 9 and spdlog 1.11. And because this can no longer solve with
# conda-forge depedencies, we install the "for-cloud" statically linked
# tiledb binary from tiledb/label/for-cloud -- see also 
# https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/tiledb-feedstock-for-cloud
