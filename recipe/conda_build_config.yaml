# conda-forge has migrated to fmt 10 and spdlog 1.12. We need fmt 9 to install
# into our existing TileDB Cloud conda environments, so we build a special
# variant of fmt 9 and spdlog 1.11. And because this can no longer solve with
# conda-forge depedencies, we install the "for-cloud" tiledb binary from
# tiledb/label/for-cloud

# Because of the awkwardness required for the cloud variant above
# (fmt9+spdlog1.11), we have to migrate the osx-* manually here. Once the
# conda-forge-pinning-feedstock is updated to spdlog 1.13, we can remove the
# manual pin below
